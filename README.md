Pharmaceutical design is very slow. Regulation, in-person testing, on-the-job drug-interaction training and schooling.. it is all very human-labored. What if the drug design market could be open-sourced? What if you could fork a compound and add a tweak to it? What if that tweak could be scanned by a machine-learning agent and checked for illegality?

The biggest question of all?

Where will open-sourcing the pharma market take us?
